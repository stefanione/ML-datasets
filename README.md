This repository contains a ipynb file in which I have trained and predicted 2 different datasets using both scikit_learn and a manual implementation
I have a preprocessing part using One-Hot Encoder, SimpleImputer and Correlation Maps follwed by eliminating the columns that affect the classification and the the training part.
